This project, developed in C# with SQL and ADO, manages a rudimentary school database. Users
                are
                presented with a menu offering various functionalities, such as adding new students or staff
                members, printing lists of students and classes, retrieving staff information, and
                generating
                reports on recent grades for specific courses or calculating average grades per course. It
                serves as a basic yet functional tool for organizing school-related data.
